# a brief, very brief tour of other programming languages.

## order
1. prolog
2. lisp
3. C#
7. awk
4. dart
5. asm
6. fortran
7. go

## notes
- So far, I love go syntax and how it is very fast compiling and all. also how it just works. it builds a exec faster
than rust and also the exec size is small. i love it a lot. let me check out what go offers, might lean more into web
dev. amo go mucho.
