1. In rust, numbers are held in defined structures which look like pythons objects( a number in python is a object n: int = 30; here int is a object which has methods)

these defines structures in rust also have methods on them which can be used to manipulate the values of the value of the number and perform calculations with.

example: 
   - you can make a number value object this way
        10_u32 or 10u32 to denote a value of 10 on a u32 integer type
		looks cool to me!!!
		
   - then perform a method like:
	    10_u32.ilog10()
		to return the baseX logarithm of the number.

		- just like python's;
		    num: int = 30
			num.as_integer_ratio()

2. i should first underscore variables which i am not planning on using them. example: _name; this way the compiler will not shout unused vars to my face
